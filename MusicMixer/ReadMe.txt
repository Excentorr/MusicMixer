TO-DO TO RUN (IMPORTANT):
Navigate to Window->Preferences->General->Workspace check the option "Refresh using native hooks and polling" https://stackoverflow.com/a/33706154/22589268
For some reason files that are accessed by FileAccess.java don't get updated until they are opened or refreshed, this option
allows for the code to update files instantly which allows the progress to be saved by the user

To run the program, start with open the "Login.java" class

Since we have our audio files outside of the jar file, ensure that the sounds folder is beside the jar file

A testing account is: 
Username: "usernameR", Password: "password"
Username: "usernameP", Password: "password"

Notes:
A premium users song time is 60 seconds whilst a regular user's songs are 20 seconds.

Bugs:
- The jar file works just that it cant read or write from text files so you cant make new accounts or save any data.
  Unsure to why as we followed the documentation posted on d2l from the start
